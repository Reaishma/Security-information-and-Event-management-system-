SIEM System Implementation ✅

Overview 📚

This repository contains the implementation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system designed to detect and respond to security threats. The system provides real-time insights into security event data, enabling swift incident response and threat detection.

Features 🚀

- *Database Schema Design* 📊: Designed to store security event data efficiently
- *Data Visualization* 📈: Interactive dashboard for visualizing security event data
- *Alerting and Notification* 📣: Notification system to alert security teams
- *Incident Response* 🚨: Response plan to handle security incidents
- *Machine Learning* 🤖: Implemented machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection

Tools and Techniques 💻

- *Database Management System* 💾: Used for storing security event data
- *Data Visualization Tool* 🎨: Used for creating interactive dashboards
- *Notification Tool* 📱: Used for alerting security teams
- *Machine Learning Library* 📚: scikit-learn for implementing anomaly detection

Outcomes 🏆

- *Improved Threat Detection* 🔍: SIEM system detects security threats in real-time
- *Enhanced Incident Response* 🚨: Response plan enables swift handling of security incidents
- *Anomaly Detection* 🔮: Machine learning algorithms detect anomalies in security event data
- *Real-time Insights* ⏱️: Provides real-time insights into security event data
